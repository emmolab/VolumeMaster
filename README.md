# VolumeMaster
VolumeMaster is a hardware application mixer for changing the volume of different  windows apps on the fly. No more digging through menus. Easily adjust the volume of your music, voice chat or game to be just how you like it.  This project is still in active development you can see all the features we plan to add [here](#what's-to-come) and if you have any feedback or requests don't hesitate to log an issue.

Recently rebranded to VolumeMaster not all docs are up to date.

# Getting Started:

## How things work
A Python script runs in the background to turn the Arduino's serial inputs into volume changes. The Arduino reads each potentiometer as a separate analogue input, this information (once mapped between [0,100]) is then sent to your computer over a COM port. The python program runs to receive the information and convert it to meaningful volume commands!  below is an image of the DIY version.

## Requirements
Currently only **Windows** is tested and supported to work. Adding Linux support is something high on our priority list.
If you have windows you're all set nothing else is needed! Go grab the [latest release](https://github.com/Wilsondotzip/HAMixer/releases) and run it inside its own folder with the config file. You can run either the GUI or headless version.

Alternatively  you can use the [source code](https://github.com/Wilsondotzip/HardwareApplicationMixer/tree/main/Software/Source) instead.

## What’s to come...
This project is still in active development, so here are some of the features we plan to add in the future.

- More cases! I mean more! All of the cases, every case. Front controls top controls you name it!
- Buttons for possible functions like muting and config switching.
